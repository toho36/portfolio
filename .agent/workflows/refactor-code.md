# Refactor Code Workflow

## 1. Analysis

Reference `.cursor/rules/06-code-quality.mdc`.

- [ ] **Structure**: Break down large functions/components.
- [ ] **SOLID**: Apply SOLID principles.
- [ ] **Naming**: Improve clarity and remove magic numbers.
- [ ] **Types**: Replace `any` with specific types.
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize algorithms and remove dead code.

## 2. Execution

- [ ] Make incremental changes.
- [ ] Ensure tests still pass (or update them).
- [ ] Verify no regressions in functionality.
