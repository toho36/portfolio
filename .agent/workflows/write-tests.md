# Write Tests Workflow

## 1. Strategy

Reference `.cursor/rules/07-basic-testing.mdc`.

- [ ] **Scope**: Focus on critical components (Hero, Contact Form) and utilities.
- [ ] **Tools**: Use Jest and React Testing Library.
- [ ] **Pattern**: Follow AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert).

## 2. Implementation

- [ ] Create `.test.tsx` file next to the component.
- [ ] Write happy path tests.
- [ ] Write edge case tests (empty states, errors).
- [ ] Mock external dependencies.

## 3. Verification

- [ ] Run `pnpm test` (or equivalent script) to verify tests pass.
