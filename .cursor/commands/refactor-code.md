# Refactor Code

Refactor selected code to improve quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## Refactoring Checklist:

1. **Code Structure**
   - Extract long functions into smaller ones
   - Break down large classes/components
   - Remove code duplication
   - Improve naming clarity

2. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Dependency Inversion
   - Interface Segregation
   - Open/Closed Principle

3. **Code Quality**
   - Extract magic numbers to constants
   - Improve variable/function names
   - Simplify complex conditionals
   - Remove dead code

4. **Type Safety**
   - Replace `any` with proper types
   - Add missing type annotations
   - Use type guards where needed

5. **Performance**
   - Optimize algorithms
   - Add memoization where beneficial
   - Remove unnecessary computations

6. **Testing**
   - Ensure refactored code is still testable
   - Maintain or improve test coverage

Provide refactored code with explanations of changes and why they improve the code quality.
