# Optimize Performance

Analyze code for performance issues and suggest optimizations.

## Performance Analysis Areas:
1. **Frontend Performance**
   - Bundle size optimization opportunities
   - Unnecessary re-renders
   - Missing memoization where beneficial
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting opportunities

2. **Backend Performance**
   - Database query optimization
   - N+1 query problems
   - Missing indexes
   - Caching opportunities
   - API response size

3. **React/Next.js Specific**
   - Server Components vs Client Components
   - Proper use of Suspense
   - Unnecessary state updates
   - Effect dependencies

4. **Database Performance**
   - Query efficiency
   - Connection pooling
   - Transaction optimization
   - Index recommendations

5. **General**
   - Algorithm complexity
   - Memory usage
   - Async/await patterns
   - Batching opportunities

Provide specific optimizations with code examples showing before/after improvements.
